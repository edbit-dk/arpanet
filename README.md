# HackLab

HackLab is a retro web-simulation of a stylized ARPANET/USENET, circa 1985-1990, a transcontinental network operated by the US Military, stretching 
from US to UK and Norway by sattelite. 

It is a full multi-user simulation, including simulated hosts from the early net, many 
of files from the era and more. The simulation takes inspiration from 
the "TeleHack" and "Hacknet" game and other terminal-focused games. 

The main focus of the project is to educate about internet 
history and technology.
